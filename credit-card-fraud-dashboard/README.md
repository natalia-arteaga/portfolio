# Uncovering Credit Card Fraud Risk Patterns

This project explores time-based and transaction-level trends in credit card fraud using SQL and Tableau.

## Project Overview

Using a real-world anonymized dataset of over 280,000 transactions found on Kaggle, this dashboard identifies:

- When fraud is most likely to occur (2â€“4 AM)
- How risk varies across transaction sizes (Low, Medium, High)
- Which combinations of time and amount show the highest fraud rates

The data was cleaned and transformed using PostgreSQL, including feature engineering such as `amount_level` and `hour_of_day`. The resulting visuals were created in Tableau Public using a clean, data-science-aligned style.

Additionally, a machine learning model was built to predict fraud using Python. Three models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 

- **XGBoost** achieved the best balance between precision and recall, making it an excellent candidate for real-time fraud detection in a banking environment.
- **Logistic Regression**, with its high recall, could be preferred for pre-screening systems where catching all possible fraudâ€”even with some false positivesâ€”is critical.
- **Random Forest** delivered the fewest false positives, favoring customer experience but missing some fraud cases.
