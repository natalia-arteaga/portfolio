# Uncovering Credit Card Fraud Risk Patterns

This project explores time-based and transaction-level trends in credit card fraud using SQL and Tableau.

## Project Overview

Using a real-world anonymized dataset of over 280,000 transactions, this dashboard identifies:

- When fraud is most likely to occur (2â€“4 AM)
- How risk varies across transaction sizes (Low, Medium, High)
- Which combinations of time and amount show the highest fraud rates

The data was cleaned and transformed using PostgreSQL, including feature engineering such as `amount_level` and `hour_of_day`. The resulting visuals were created in Tableau Public using a clean, data-science-aligned style.
